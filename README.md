# Combined chatbot image transformer

This repository contains my code and report for the project 1 course at the University of Vienna in WS2022. The goal was to combine a chatbot and image captioning transformer into a single model with the ability to answer questions based on images supplied as context. As an additional requirement, the relative influence of the chatbot and the image captioning model should be a fixed or learnable model parameter. In order to reduce the amount of required training data, existing pre-trained models (DialoGPT and ViT pre-trained for image captioning) were combined to solve the task. More information can be found in the [project report](project_report.pdf).
