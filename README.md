# Combined chatbot image transformer

This repository contains my code and project report for the project 1 course at the University of Vienna in WS2022. The goal of this project was to combine a chatbot and image captioning transformer into a single model with the ability to answer questions based on images supplied as context. As an additional requirement, the influence of the chatbot and the image captioning model should be a fixed or learnable model parameter. In order to reduce the amount of required training data, existing pre-trained models (DialoGPT and ViT pre-trained for image captioning) were combined to solve the task. Different configurations were evaluated with the perplexity metric, investigating the quality of the generated output.
